  "capitalMarketsRecap": "The capital markets experienced a significant amount of volatility during the past quarter.  Fixed income performed well with high grade and high yield bonds delivering total returns of 2.7% and 1.2%, respectively.   Equities saw broad based declines with the S&P 500, MSCI World, and Russell 2000 experiencing declines of 4.3%, 3.0%, and 9.5%, respectively.  Commodities saw a strong gain of 7.7% though most of this was lost in the period following the end of the quarter.  We have been positioning for higher levels of volatility in the markets and will be looking to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves.",
