    "capitalMarketsRecap": "The capital markets experienced a significant amount of volatility during the past quarter.  Fixed income performed well with high grade and high yield bonds delivering total returns of 2.7% and 1.2%, respectively.   Equities saw broad based declines with the S&P 500, MSCI World, and Russell 2000 experiencing declines of 4.3%, 3.0%, and 9.5%, respectively.  Commodities saw a strong gain of 7.7% though most of this was lost in the period following the end of the quarter.  We have been positioning for higher levels of volatility in the markets and will be looking to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves.",

    "commentary": "The Growth Model seeks to generate attractive, risk-adjusted total returns through a combination of capital appreciation and dividend income. The model invests in equity securities diversified by sector, geography, and market capitalization. Security selection and portfolio construction are driven by a fundamental, bottom-up investment process. The Growth Model maintains a style bias toward securities with higher growth rates or superior quality metrics relative to their sector or the broader market.\n\nThe Growth Model uses the MSCI World Index as a performance and risk management benchmark. This index measures the performance of more than 1,500 large- and mid-cap companies in 23 developed countries, capturing approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country. The index is market cap weighted, and its country and sector allocations evolve over time in response to differences in market performance and capital markets activity.\n\nRisk management plays a key role in portfolio construction and monitoring. Exposures across geography, sector, style factor, and market cap are monitored to ensure they remain within our risk tolerance guidelines. All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. Economic topics that could negatively impact returns include weak growth, rising interest rates, and high inflation. Investments in foreign securities involve additional risks, such as currency fluctuations, as well as economic and political uncertainty. Investments in small and/or newer companies are subject to further risks, as these securities can be especially volatile in the short term.\n",

Fixed income securities performed poorly during the period with the US Aggregate Index declining 4.3% as the US 10-year Treasury yield rose from 3.79% to 4.57%. The Nuveen CLO Issuance Fund delivered a total return of 0.98% during the quarter, comprised of a 6.41% distribution offset by a 5.43% price decline. The fund continues to meet our expectations with a 13.8% net IRR since its inception as 12/31/25."

Our goal is to deliver homes that are very price competitive to both new and existing homes in the area. While an economic downturn could reduce the demand for new homes, we believe there will continue to be adequate demand in Oroville given the supply-constrained market."

Given the rise in interest rates and cap rates since we invested in the fund, we are anticipating a decline in the fund’s value in the near term. But we expect these values to recover due to the high quality of these assets and the strong demand for affordable housing."
