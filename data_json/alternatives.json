      "label": "Nuveen CLO Issuance Fund LP",
      "commentary": "Performance results for the first quarter have not been released, so these comments refer to the fourth quarter of 2024. Fixed income securities performed poorly during the period with the US Aggregate Index declining 4.3% as the US 10-year Treasury yield rose from 3.79% to 4.57%. The Nuveen CLO Issuance Fund delivered a total return of 0.98% during the quarter, comprised of a 6.41% distribution offset by a 5.43% price decline. The fund continues to meet our expectations with a 13.8% net IRR since its inception as 12/31/25."

      "commentary": "We continue to work with our partner Skyline to lower the cost of the homes that will be delivered to the River Ranch project. Our goal is to deliver homes that are very price competitive to both new and existing homes in the area. While an economic downturn could reduce the demand for new homes, we believe there will continue to be adequate demand in Oroville given the supply-constrained market."

      "label": "Beacon 2 Fund",
      "commentary": "The fund is completing the change of the general partner to Usonia Partners, LLC. We will be receiving the year end audit later this month. Given the rise in interest rates and cap rates since we invested in the fund, we are anticipating a decline in the fundâ€™s value in the near term. But we expect these values to recover due to the high quality of these assets and the strong demand for affordable housing."
